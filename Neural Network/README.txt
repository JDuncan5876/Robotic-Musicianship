This an implementation of a simple 3-layer neural network. The primary file
(networkGUI.m) uses the Microsoft Kinect to train a network to recognize
whether a drummer is playing the hi-hat cymbal or the ride cymbal. Some
other test files (such as XOR gates) are included as well. The network
itself was based off of the one created in the fourth assignment of Stanford's
Machine Learning course on Coursera. Fmincg was provided by the course.
This program will be extended in the fall to classify all of the drums
in a drum set and to improve robustness. Eventually more complicated networks
will be used to train our robotic drumming third arm to move like a
human drummer using real data taken by the Kinect.
